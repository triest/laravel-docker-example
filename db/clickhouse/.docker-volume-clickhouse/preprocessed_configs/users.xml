            <!-- How to choose between replicas during distributed query processing.
                 random - choose random replica from set of replicas with minimum number of errors
                 nearest_hostname - from set of replicas with minimum number of errors, choose replica
                  with minimum number of different symbols between replica's hostname and local hostname
                  (Hamming distance).
                 in_order - first live replica is chosen in specified order.
                 first_or_random - if first replica one has higher number of errors, pick a random one from replicas with minimum number of errors.
